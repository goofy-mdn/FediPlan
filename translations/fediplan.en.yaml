    about:
      FediPlan is an open source application (<a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fediplan" target="_blank">source code</a>) built for scheduling your messages with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://pleroma.social/" target="_blank">Pleroma</a> (2.7+).
    data:
      It <b>does not store any data</b> (token or messages), that is why you need to create a new Token when your session expired.
  about:
    scheduling:
      FediPlan allows users to schedule a message (with media attachments) to be published at a certain future date.<br/>
      The scheduled date must be at least 5 minutes into the future. At most, 300 statuses can be scheduled at the same time.
      Only 50 statuses can be scheduled for any given day.
    data:
      FediPlan does not store your scheduled messages nor your credentials. It only uses the Mastodon API for <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/rest/statuses/#scheduled-status" target="_blank">scheduling messages</a>
    issues:
      You can report issues or ask improvements on <a href="https://github.com/stom79/FediPlan/issues" target="_blank">Github</a> or <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fediplan/issues" target="_blank">Framagit</a>.
